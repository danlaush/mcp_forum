==MCP Applicants Question Forum

This app is designed to be a simple to use and simple to read web space for [AIESEC US](http://aiesecus.org) MCP candidates to answer questions from stakeholders in the runup to yearly elections.

This is more a proof of concept/ practice with RoR. AIESEC conversations should happen on the internal platform for posterity.
